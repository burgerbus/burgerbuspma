The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex evolution of the Bitcoin Bens Burger Bus Club" application. Initially, it involved fixing Solana JWT issues, pivoting to BCH, and finally settling on email/password authentication with P2P fiat payments. A significant portion of the work focused on implementing a pump.fun token ticker and an advanced BBC token staking system. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in debugging persistent frontend JSX errors, resolving backend API issues (missing endpoints, incorrect Pydantic models, data fetching), and correcting authentication flow discrepancies. The most recent task involved implementing a backend treasury system for staking rewards.

<product_requirements>
The "Bitcoin Bens Burger Bus Club is a private membership application with evolving requirements. Initially, it aimed for blockchain authorization, dynamic menus, member-exclusive content, pre-ordering, and membership tiers. Key changes included rebranding, adding a 1 PMA agreement with a 5 BCH cashstamp, and transitioning from Solana/BCH wallet authentication to email/password login. P2P fiat payment gateways (CashApp, Venmo, Zelle) were integrated alongside BCH, with crypto discounts. An affiliate system (/signup) was implemented.
The current work integrated a pump.fun token for a homepage ticker, rewards, and food discounts. Most recently, a staking contract for 1,000,000  tokens for membership was requested. Membership was made free, and non-BCH payment methods were marked Coming Soon. Wallet connection for staking was separated. The latest request concerned how the rewards contract is funded and managed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating a comprehensive rewards treasury system for the  token staking. The user explicitly asked, How is the rewards contract funded and managed? In response, the engineer implemented the backend logic for treasury management, including endpoints for initialization, funding, distribution, balance tracking, history, and emergency pause capabilities within  and a new  module. Following this, the engineer created a detailed documentation file, , which outlines how the rewards system works, its funding sources, admin controls, and safety mechanisms. This work ensures the backend infrastructure for managing BBC token staking rewards is in place and documented, ready for further integration or testing.

<optional_next_step>
Test the newly added backend treasury management endpoints to ensure they are fully functional and secure.
