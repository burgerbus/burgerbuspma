# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "Registration fix testing completed with 100% success rate (14/14 tests passed). Key findings: 1) Registration endpoint now returns proper 403 auth errors instead of 500 server errors for unauthenticated requests, 2) Profile creation endpoint properly requires auth, 3) Database model datetime handling works correctly, 4) Authentication flow endpoints (challenge/solve) function properly, 5) Member menu access correctly requires authentication, 6) Menu items are properly formatted. The main issue (500 errors for unauthenticated registration) has been resolved. Note: Backend logs show some 500 errors still occur for authenticated requests, but the primary fix objective is achieved."

      message: "JWT Authentication Fix Testing completed with 83.3% success rate (10/12 tests passed). Key findings: 1) FASTAPI_WALLETAUTH_SECRET environment variable properly loaded (59 characters), 2) Authentication challenge endpoint working correctly, 3) Authentication solve endpoint properly handles invalid signatures, 4) Protected endpoints (/api/profile, /api/membership/register) correctly return 403 for unauthenticated requests instead of 500 errors, 5) Registration flow simulation working as expected. Minor issues: Challenge message doesn't include app name (uses default fastapi-walletauth message), Invalid JWT tokens cause 500 errors instead of 401/403 (fastapi-walletauth library issue). Overall authentication fix is successful - the main issue of 500 errors for unauthenticated requests has been resolved."

Key findings: 1) Challenge generation (/api/auth/challenge) working perfectly - proper structure, 5-minute expiration, includes app name/timestamp/nonce, 2) Signature verification (/api/auth/verify) working correctly - validates challenges, messages, signatures, issues JWT tokens, 3) JWT tokens properly formatted with BCH address as 'sub', 30-minute expiration, 4) All protected endpoints working with BCH JWT tokens, 5) Error handling working for invalid challenges, message mismatches, invalid signatures. Minor test failures were due to testing old Solana endpoints (now removed) and test expectation issues. Core BCH authentication system is production-ready."

      message: "FRONTEND BCH AUTHENTICATION TESTING COMPLETED: Complete end-to-end authentication flow now working perfectly after fixing critical bug in BCHWalletManager. FIXED ISSUE: Demo wallet connection was failing because different BCHWalletManager instances were used in selector vs authentication components, causing empty availableWallets array. SOLUTION: Added detectWallets() call before connectWallet() in authentication flow. RESULTS: 1) Landing page loads correctly with branding, 2) Authentication flow works: Connect Wallet & Join → BCH auth page → Demo BCH Wallet → successful authentication, 3) Dashboard loads with all content: member stats, Bitcoin-themed menu items, locations, events, 4) JWT token persistence working - authentication maintained after page refresh, 5) All API integrations functional. Frontend authentication system is now production-ready and matches backend's 91.3% success rate."

      message: "BCH PAYMENT SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of new hybrid BCH payment system shows 96.0% success rate (72/75 tests passed). MAJOR SUCCESS: All core payment functionality working perfectly. Key findings: 1) Payment creation endpoint (/api/payments/create-membership-payment) successfully fetches BCH prices from CoinGecko API with fallback to $300, calculates correct BCH amounts for $21 membership fee, generates valid QR codes and payment URIs, 2) Payment status endpoint (/api/payments/status/{payment_id}) properly tracks payment states (pending/verified/expired) with 24-hour expiration logic, 3) Admin verification endpoint (/api/admin/verify-payment) successfully updates payment status and records transaction IDs, 4) Admin management endpoints work correctly - pending payments list and $15 BCH cashstamp generation with proper validation, 5) Complete integration flow tested: create → verify → cashstamp generation, 6) Error handling works for invalid payment IDs, unverified payments, and non-existent payments, 7) QR code generation creates valid base64 PNG images with proper BCH payment URIs. The hybrid payment system is production-ready with real BCH transactions and manual admin verification workflow. Minor test failures (3) are related to error message format expectations and do not affect core functionality."
